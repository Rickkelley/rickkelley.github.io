            <h2>I keep hearing about classes of rapids. What is all that about</h2>
            <p>There are 6 classes in the international scale of river difficulty. Those are:</p>
            <ul id=rapid>
                <li>Class 1: Moving water with small waves that tug at the boat, it's a relaxing way to spend the day. Most rivers have some stretches of calm class 1 water, creating a pleasant break between rapids</li>
                <li>Class 2: Easy rapids, waves up to three feet tall that are readily seen, and wide channels that can be discovered without scouting. Some maneuvering is required during this little rock and roll. </li>
                <li>Class 3: Waves up to four fee and narrow passages that send the boat shimmying and water gushing over it's sides. Plenty of excitement.</li>
                <li>Class 4: Long difficult rapids, narrow passages, turbulent water that requires precise maneuvering and sends hearts racing.</li>
                <li>Class 5: All of class 4 and then some. You will see large waves, complex gushing rapids, twisting and spinning. Delivers the consummate adrenaline rush</li>
                <li>Class 6: The extreme "un-runnable" rivers and or waterfalls. Only the most expert should attempt this - usually seen in extreme kayak videos, etc. Outfitter raft trips don't go here, there's too much other water to enjoy without risking it all!</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Are your tours a good trip for kids? And what are the age ranges you allow?</h2>
            <p>Absolutely our tours are a good trip for children of all ages. Depending on the trip what age ranges are allowed, see our tours page for those details. We have found however that children over the age of 8 seem to enjoy it more overall (And parents especially enjoy it more if their children are all over 8). A common concern we get from parents is that their children will be bored stuck on a boat for hours at a time. Surprisingly we deal with very few bored children of any age. The areas we are rafting through are some of the most beautiful in the world, and you never know what you might see around any corner. Not to mention the rapids which keep things very interesting. Each boat also comes equipped with a guide. It has been proven that river guides are unable to go for very long at all without telling stories...some of which are even true!</p>

            <h2>Is whitewater rafting safe? I don't even know how to swim! Can I still come?</h2>
            <p>As with all adventure sports, there is an inherent and assumed element of risk. To help ensure your safety, our guides are all certified in Wilderness First aid and CPR. They are all also certified by the International Rafting Federation. The most common injuries are sunburns and injuries that occur on land. Everyone on any of our rafting trips wears a coast guard approved life vest. Also, many non swimmers go on our rafting trips and have a great time. Your guide will give you an in depth and engaging safety talk before your trip begins explaining what you should prepare for and do in the event that you fall out of your boat.
            </p>

            <h2>What is included in the trip?</h2>
            <p>We provide all of the necessary equipment for your trip. This includes your life vest, and a wetsuit(Only needed early spring due to snow runoff affecting the water temperature), canteens of drinking water and lemonade. Should your trip include one or more meals, we provide all the food, eating utensils and a camping chair. Should your trip be more than one day long, we will also provide tents, sleeping bags and sheets. Coffee, tea and hot chocolate is provided during the morning and evening hours.</p>

            <h2>What do I need to bring?</h2>
            <p>That depends on you, you will find that the most effective way to plan for temperature and weather changes in the Canyon is to be prepared for both hot & dry and cold & wet. You might consider a Rain jacket and rain pants- do not bring ponchos Quick dry shirts and shorts. Long sleeve cotton shirt and pants- helps keep you cooler on hot days. Button down shirts provide more sun protection on the neck. Light Weight Cotton Pant, Nylon Pant or Sarong are the best thing for men to wear along with swim trunks as shorts. If you are cold natured, bring polypropylene long underwear top and bottom Women wear swim suits or quick dry underwear and sport bras as a base layer during the day. Over the base layer, wear a pair of quick dry shorts and the shirt of your choice (polypropylene if you are cold, cotton if you are hot). Two piece swim suits are convenient when changing or going to the bathroom. A large brim hat offers protection from the sun, just make sure it has a good quality strap. Sunglasses also with a strap, socks- used for hiking and to protect your feet from the sun. Sandals or water shoes- if you are not used to hiking in these, bring a pair of shoes you have hiked in before. We also suggest you bring something comfortable to wear around camp. Cotton dresses, skirts and sarongs are all popular options. Sleep wear: You might choose to sleep in your camp wear. Otherwise, you might like to bring something comfortable to sleep in. Water bottle, small day pack for hikes, moisturizing lotion, headlamp or flashlight, moleskin, waterproof sunscreen and lip balm, gloves,fleece jacket,towel,bandana, small pillow. Hygiene products like toothpaste, toothbrush, tissue, nail clippers, feminine hygiene products, extra eyeglasses or contacts, biodegradable soap and shampoo camera equipment book, watercolors, journal and pen.</p>

            <h2>What is so great about whitewater rafting anyway?</h2>
            <p>Are you kidding me! What's not great about whitewater rafting!...Let's describe a common day on the river. Arise in the soft light of the early morning after a night spent sleeping under a beautiful starry sky. Have a hearty warm breakfast of fresh blueberry pancakes or omelets to order, then pack your things and prepare for the day. The day is filled with some combination of swift water, rapids, calms, hikes, history, geology, stories, and more good food. We try to hit camp around 4 or 5, after setting up your cot you can relax with a good book or good company by the river, or explore around camp while your guides prepare your dinner...something perhaps like steak and potatoes, or grilled salmon...and dutch oven apple cobbler...you won't forget the dutch oven apple cobbler. After dinner it's more relaxing, and you might even be able to talk your guide into another story or two to send you off to bed under more stars than you thought were possible.</p>

            <h2>Can I do big whitewater rafting even if I am a first timer</h2>
            <p>We don't recomend rapids above a class 2 for the elderly, or those under 12. Otherwise, yes since we fit the size of the boats to the size of the whitewater. In many ways it depends more on where you sit on that raft than which class of rapids you choose. If you can grip a rope and follow the guide's instructions, you are as ready as you need to be for starting out. On rivers where the rapids are more moderate, we may bring along paddleboats and inflatable kayaks to let the more adventurous get their thrill while the more conservative can simply grip the ropes on an oar-powered raft.</p>
