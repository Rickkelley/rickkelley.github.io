        The target audience for our weather page will be the people who live, work, and or play in and around Preston Idaho. We will include towns of Soda Springs, home of the worlds only captive geyser, and fish haven. So named for the plethora of fisherman passing through on their way to fish at nearby Bear Lake. 
        </p>

        <p>
We are planning for two personas. The first would be those people who live and work in the area. For them we will provide a comunity calendar of events in the area. For this calendar we will welcome input from the public on things they think their neighbors will be interested in. We will include on the calendar things like the dates of huckleberry picking season, and if the weather will permit you to go and gather some that day. We would communicate with the local school districts, and put on our site a notice to let you know if a weather event is affecting the area in some way. For example, to much snow all at once and as such schools are closed. We will post the antcipated dates of harvest break for the schools. Which will allow the farmers to better plan what dates their children will be available to help with the potato harvest.

    The second persona we will cater to will be the tourists. For them we will provide updates on what streams the fish are biting in the area. We will provide the expected weather on and around Bear Lake for those in the area of Fish Haven, as well as the reservoirs near Preston & Soda Springs. We will provide directions to and information around some of the popular tourist attractions in the area to include the Soda Springs geyser, Hooper Springs, chesterfield ghost town, and Lava Hot springs.
